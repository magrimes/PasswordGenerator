# PasswordGenerator

Homework Assignment 3

Goal: to create a responsive webpage application that generates a random password. This is based on what information the user has selected from prompts to include in the password sequence. 

## Description

The purpose of this application is to create a random password for the user based on the prompted options they are given below. They must select at least one character type and follow length guidelines for the application to work properly.

* Length (between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character types:

    * Special characters

    * Numbers

    * Lowercase letters

    * Uppercase letters

Once all prompts are selected, the password is displayed on the webpage when the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button. The user has the option to click the 'Copy to Clipboard' button to copy the password.
